# JavaScript-Learn-Everything
This notes for JS includes Variables &amp; Declarations, Data Types + Type System, Operators, Control Flow, Loops, Functions, Arrays and Objects. This is a tutorial by Sheriyans Coding School, so all the credit goes to them for such a wonderful experience, I just made a note out of the lecture for my future self to brush on JS concepts if I need to !
